          <h3>Leslie : The founder of Vintage Rally Club</h3>
          <p>Set in the year 2021, 4 friends: Leslie, Dylan, Martin, and Greg got together to talk about their favorite topic: vintage cars. They spent hours discussing the models and their details.<br>One day they took a break from work to visit a nearby car show. While walking around, they came across a wealthy couple who were also very interested in vintage cars. They started talking to them and got to know that they were also into car racing.<br>That same night they came up with the idea of having a race with vintage cars! Their 3 friends soon got on board with the idea and they soon planned everything out. They were super excited for the race, but first they wanted to make sure no one else would want to compete in it. They talked about this at length and all agreed that there would be no other competitors for the upcoming race against them four friends. Then they made this vintage rally club.</p>
